    <h3> Introduction </h3>
    <p> Hello! My name is Gianna Baum. I am proudly based out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It's the place I've called home my whole life. </p>
    <br>
      <p> Currently, I am a student at Thinkful, learning fullstack web development, with hopes to have a career as a front end web developer someday.</p>

    <h3> About Me</h3>
    <p> I would describe myself as a creative person, with an appreciation for logic and structure. This is what ultimately led me to my passion of web development.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Before my interest in web development, I was a music student of three years, as it is a creative passion of mine. While music is still a big part of my life, I decided to channel the creative energy I have into a new outlet!</p>
    <br>
    <p> When working in web development, these are the things I value: </p> 
      <ul>
      <li> Collaborating with others</li> 
      <li> Serving people in any way I can</li>
      <li> Hearing the insight and opinions of those around me on projects</li> 
    </ul>
